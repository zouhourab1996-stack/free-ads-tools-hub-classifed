## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Direct Build Upload (Recommended for GitHub Pages)

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an optimized `dist` folder with all your static files.

2. **Upload to GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to the `gh-pages` branch (create if needed)
   - Delete all existing files in the branch
   - Upload ALL contents from the `dist` folder to the root of `gh-pages` branch
   - Commit the changes

3. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from branch
   - Branch: `gh-pages` / (root)
   - Save

4. **Access your site:**
   Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Method 2: Using GitHub Actions (Automated)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
